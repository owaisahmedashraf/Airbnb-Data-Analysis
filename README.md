# Airbnb Data Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze Airbnb data to uncover patterns and insights using various exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. The analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's structure, summary statistics, and key trends. This project is documented in a Jupyter Notebook, which includes step-by-step explanations and visualizations.

## Overview

The Airbnb Data Analysis Project involves the following steps:

1. **Importing Essential Libraries:** Utilizing libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` to handle data manipulation and visualization tasks.
2. **Loading the Dataset:** Reading the Airbnb dataset from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
3. **Initial Data Inspection:** Printing the first 20 rows of the dataset to get an initial understanding of its structure and content.
4. **Data Shape Analysis:** Determining the shape of the dataset to understand its dimensions and implications.
5. **Column Renaming:** Replacing spaces in column labels with underscores for consistency and ease of use.
6. **Data Types Check:** Inspecting the data types of each attribute to understand the type of data each column holds.
7. **Data Type Conversion:** Converting specific columns to appropriate data types, such as changing `minimum_night` and `price` from float to integer, and converting `last_review` to datetime type.
8. **Dataset Information:** Extracting detailed information about the dataset to understand the significance of each column in EDA.
9. **Summary Statistics for Numerical Columns:** Providing summary statistics for numerical columns and highlighting any unusual calculations.
10. **Summary Statistics for Categorical Columns:** Providing summary statistics for categorical columns and highlighting any unusual findings.
11. **Duplicate Rows Identification and Removal:** Ensuring data integrity by identifying and removing duplicate rows.
12. **Handling Missing Values:** Checking for null or empty values in each column and replacing them with suitable replacements.
13. **Column Dropping:** Removing unnecessary columns such as `last_review`, `names`, and `id` to streamline the dataset.
14. **Unique Values Analysis:** Finding the number of unique values in specific columns and addressing any unusual results.
15. **Top Hosts Analysis:** Identifying the top 10 host IDs with the highest number of bookings.
16. **Visualization of Top Hosts:** Creating a bar chart to visualize the top 10 host names based on the number of bookings.
17. **Room Types and Price Range Analysis:** Analyzing the types of rooms offered by the host with the highest number of bookings and their price range.
18. **Neighbourhood Group Analysis:** Identifying the neighbourhood group with the highest number of bookings and visualizing the data using a pie chart.
19. **Price Analysis:** Calculating the average price of all listings, as well as determining the minimum and maximum prices.
20. **Room Type Price Comparison:** Comparing the average prices of different room types.
21. **Neighbourhood Group Reviews Analysis:** Identifying the neighbourhood group with the highest number of reviews and highlighting any interesting findings.

## Techniques Used

The project utilizes the following EDA techniques:

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types to ensure data integrity and consistency.
- **Data Transformation:** Renaming columns and converting data types to facilitate analysis.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Generating summary statistics for numerical and categorical columns to understand the central tendency, dispersion, and distribution of data.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating bar charts and pie charts to visualize key trends and patterns in the data.
- **Aggregation and Grouping:** Analyzing data by grouping it based on specific columns to uncover insights related to host activities, room types, neighbourhood groups, and more.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of EDA techniques to understand and analyze Airbnb data. The insights gained from this analysis can help in making data-driven decisions and identifying key trends in the Airbnb market.
